Exercise 0.1: Manipulating files and folders

Write a bash script called unpack which can unpack multiple packed files (a.k.a “archives”),
and even traverse folders recursively and unpack all archives in them - regardless of the
specific algorithm that was used when packing them. Following is the exact synopsis:
unpack [-r] [-v] file [file...]
Given a list of filenames as input, this script queries each target file (parsing the output of the
file command) for the type of compression used on it. Then the script automatically invokes
the appropriate decompression command, putting files in the same folder. If files with the
same name already exist, they are overwritten.
Unpack should support 4 unpacking options - gunzip, bunzip2, unzip, uncompress.
Adding more options should be VERY simple.
Note that file names and extensions have no meaning - the only way to know what method
to use is through the file command!
If a target file is not compressed, the script takes no other action on that particular file.
If the target is a directory then it decompresses all files in it using same method.
Command echos number of archives decompressed
Command returns number of files it did NOT decompress
Additional switches:
-v - verbose - echo each file decompressed & warn for each file that was NOT
decompressed
-r - recursive - will traverse contents of folders recursively, performing unpack on each.
The following page contains some examples.

~$ unpack my-zip-file
Decompressed 1 archive(s)
What happened? The contents of my-zip-file were written into ~. Command returned 0
(success)

~$ unpack my-zip-file my-bz2-file
Decompressed 2 archive(s)
What happened? The contents of my-zip-file and my-bz2-file were written into ~. Command
returned 0 (success)

~$ unpack some-text-file
Decompressed 0 archive(s)
What happened? Command returned 1 (failure for 1 file)

~$ unpack -v *
Unpacking my-bz2-file…
Unpacking my-zip-file...
Ignoring some-text-file
Decompressed 2 archive(s)
What happened? Assuming the directory ~ contained some-text-file, my-zip-file and
my-bz2-file then the contents of my-zip-file and my-bz2-file were written into ~ and command
returned 1 (failure for 1 file)

~$ unpack -v some-folder
Unpacking a.zip...
Unpacking b.bz2...
Decompressed 2 archive(s)
What happened? Assuming that some-folder had 2 archives and no other files then they
were unpacked. If it had any subfolders, they were ignored and command returned 0
(success)

~$ unpack -r some-folder
Decompressed 17 archive(s)
What happened? Assuming that some-folder (and all of its subfolders) had a total of 20 files
of which 17 where archives, this would extract them all - each at its location - and return 3
(failure for 3 files)
The attached zip file, excercise0.1.zip, contains some archives, to help you test the script as
you write it.
